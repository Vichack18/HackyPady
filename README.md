HackyPady is a project where I was able to (almost) create my own keyboard.

My inspiration arose from my great curiosity to know how a keyboard worked and what it was like inside. 

My big challenge was creating the firmware (still in development), but it looks incredible!

The best of all was creating the case in Fusion 360 since I have experience in the software B)
